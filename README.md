# JavaFun
A series of Java code for fun and for assignments from CSC 501.

Calculating Future Investment Value:

  The program will prompt the user for a an investment value, an annual interest rate, and the amount of years that the investment would be saved. The result of the future investment value is displayed using the formula : futureInvestmentValue = investment + ( 1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^ numberOfYears * 12.
  
  
  Computing Tax:
  
  This program will prompt the user for a filing status (0-3) for Single, Married filing Jointly or Widow(er), Married filing separately, and Head of Household. The program will then prompt the user for the amount of taxable income they have earned. Finally, the results of the amount of tax owed will be displayed using the federal personal income tax bracket from 2009.
  
  
Phone keypad:
  This program will ask the user to input only one letter, either uppercase or lowercase, and will display a corresponding number based on the international mapping number/letter list. For example, the letter "a" corresponds to 2. 


Max value count:
  This program will ask the user to input integers in a sequence until the value "0" is input, it will then calculate the max value integer and the number of times it occurred in the sequence.

Guess the number:
  This is a fun game that uses a loop and the Math.random method to guess the random number between 0 and 100. The program will randomly choose a number and when the user guesses, the program will display results whether the guess is too high, too low, or the correct number.
